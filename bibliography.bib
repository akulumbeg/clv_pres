	abstract = {Service churn and retention rates remain central as constructs in marketing activities, such as valuation of service subscribers and resource allocation. Although extant approaches have been proposed to relate service churn to external factors, such as reported satisfaction, marketing-mix activities, and so on, managers often face situations in which the only information available is the duration for which subscribers have had service. In such cases, can they forecast service churn and understand the contributing factors, which may allow for subsequent intervention? The authors propose a framework to examine factors that may underlie service retention in a contractual setting. Specifically, they use a model of retention that accounts for (1) duration dependence, (2) promotional effects, (3) subscriber heterogeneity, (4) cross-cohort effects, and (5) calendar-time effects (e.g., seasonality).Then, they apply the framework to subscription databases of seven services offered by a telecommunications provider, mirroring the format commonly used to forecast future service churn (and to make managerial decisions). Across all seven services, the inclusion of promotional effects always improves the forecast accuracy of retention behavior, whereas including cross-cohort effects does not significantly improve it. In five of the services, customer heterogeneity, calendar-time effects, and duration dependence also contribute to improved forecasts. The authors use these results to understand how the expected value of a subscription differs across model specifications. They find considerable variation across model specifications, indicating that model misspecification can affect resource allocation decisions and other marketing efforts that are important to a firm.},

	abstract = {Cohort-level retention rates typically increase over time, and the beta-geometric (BG) distribution has proven to be a robust model for capturing and projecting these patterns into the future. According to this model, the phenomenon of increasing cohort-level retention rates is purely due to cross-sectional heterogeneity; an individual customer's propensity to churn does not change over time. In this paper we present the beta-discrete-Weibull (BdW) distribution as an extension to the BG model, which allows individual-level churn probabilities to increase or decrease over time. In addition to capturing the phenomenon of increasing cohort-level retention rates, this new model can also accommodate situations in which there is an initial dip in retention rates before they increase (i.e., a U-shaped cohort-level retention curve). A key finding is that even when aggregate retention rates are monotonically increasing, the individual-level churn probabilities are unlikely to be declining over time, as conventional wisdom would suggest. We carefully explore these connections between heterogeneity, duration dependence, and the shape of the retention curve, and draw some managerially relevant conclusions, e.g., that accounting for cross-sectional heterogeneity is more important than accounting for any individual-level dynamics in churn propensities.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method that uses online ratings to predict business failures.
          , 
            The success, if not survival, of service businesses depends on their ability to satisfy their customers. Yet, businesses often recognize slumping customer satisfaction too late and ultimately fail. To prevent this, marketers require early warning tools. In this paper, we build upon online ratings as a direct measure of customer satisfaction and, based on this, predict business failures. Specifically, we develop a variable-duration hidden Markov model; it models the rating sequence of a service business in order to predict the likelihood of failure. Using 64,887 ratings from 921 restaurants, we find that our model detects business failures with a balanced accuracy of 78.02\%, and this prediction is even possible several months in advance. In comparison, simple metrics from practice have limited ability in predicting business failures; for instance, the mean rating yields a balanced accuracy of only around 50\%. Furthermore, our model recovers a latent state (“at risk”) with an elevated failure rate. Avoiding the at-risk state is associated with a reduction in the failure rate of more than 41.41\%. Our research thus entails direct managerial implications: we assist marketers in monitoring customer satisfaction and, for this purpose, offer a data-driven tool that provides early warnings of impending business failures.},

This textual information has a substantial and significant ability to predict whether borrowers will pay back the loan above and beyond the financial and demographic variables commonly used in models predicting default. The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower’s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words. The authors further observe that defaulting loan requests are written in a manner consistent with the writing styles of extroverts and liars.},

To fill this gap, we provide a counting rule on the number of nonzero factor loadings that is sufficient for achieving uniqueness of the variance decomposition in the factor representation. Furthermore, we introduce the generalised lower triangular representation to resolve rotational invariance and show that within this model class the unknown number of common factors can be recovered in an overfitting sparse factor model. By combining point-mass mixture priors with a highly efficient and customised MCMC scheme, we obtain posterior summaries regarding the number of common factors as well as the factor loadings via postprocessing. Our methodology is illustrated for monthly exchange rates of 22 currencies with respect to the euro over a period of eight years and for monthly log returns of 73 firms from the NYSE100 over a period of 20 years.},
