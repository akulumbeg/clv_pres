# Introduction

## Story

- Contractual setting - curated shopping
- Nation-wide apparel subscription box service provider
- Female customers only

<br>

- Monthly surprise boxes with clothes selected by a stylist (person)
- Option for customer to approve or change something in the box
- Once received - rating of each item by categories and with optional written feedback


## Story II

![](./Graphics/story.png)


## Idea

- Propensity to churn changes over time
- Traditionally data is 
    - hard to obtain
    - static / collected once
- Written feedback contains (un)conscious pieces of information
- Feedback changes over time
    - Stylist did a better/worse job than before
    - Clothes' color/fit/cut/size/material is good/bad
    - Items did/didn't adhere to the customer preferences stated in the quiz
    - ...
    
## Problem

- What is hiding in the dynamic feedback (e.g., emotionality, eloquence, engagement...)?
- How do these components influence the risk of customer attrition?
- Can we identify other (latent) time-varying signals that affect customer lifetime?
